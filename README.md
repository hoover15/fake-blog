VERY BASIC incoporation of JS for light/dark mode toggle
Based off of a public codecademy project/challenge thing (https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/web-dev-independent-project-1-turn-a-site-mobile-responsive/419937). i havent styled this page much aside from dark/light theme and media queries, those being the main draws of the challenge.

First time using js in a website to make a simple light/dark mode toggle button. i have to learn SVG to make an actual custom icon for it which id rather do later.
i'm pretty sure the layout of this site is what i wanted from the first try website.
still at a basic level but i like that i actually was able to use some JS even if it was only like 12 lines. that code will hopefully be recyclable anyways
